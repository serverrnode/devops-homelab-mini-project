# 🏠 DevOps Homelab Mini Projects

This repository contains small hands-on projects I’m building in my homelab while learning DevOps fundamentals in my free time.

The focus is on learning by doing — containerisation, CI pipelines, and running applications on real servers — rather than building production-ready software.

---

## 📁 Projects in this Repository

### 🌤️ Weather Homelab App
A simple weather web application with a frontend and backend, fully containerised with Docker and validated using GitHub Actions CI.

**What it demonstrates**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Frontend + backend architecture
- Consuming a public API (Open-Meteo)
- GitHub Actions CI for build and smoke testing
- Running applications in a homelab environment

📂 Location:
```
weather-homelab/
```

---

### 🧪 Dummy App (Early Learning Project)
A very small dummy application used to learn basic Docker, Git, and CI concepts.

This project was used as an initial stepping stone before building more complete applications.

**What it demonstrates**
- Basic Dockerfile usage
- Docker Compose
- Simple CI concepts

📂 Location:
```
dummy-app/
```

---

## 🧠 Why a Homelab?
Using a homelab allows me to:
- Practice Linux server administration
- Run containerised applications end-to-end
- Experiment safely without cloud costs
- Learn how CI/CD fits into real environments

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used Across Projects
- Linux
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- Basic networking and APIs

---

## 📌 Notes
These projects are intentionally kept small and simple.
They are built to support learning and experimentation rather than as polished production systems.

---

## 🔮 Possible Next Steps
- Automated deployments to the homelab
- Monitoring and metrics
- Kubernetes (k3s) experiments
- Infrastructure as Code

---

Thanks for checking out my homelab projects 👋
